##Purpose

The purpose of this application is to use JavaScript to create a multiple choice quiz.  The functionality of this quiz application demonstrates a basic understanding of javascript functions, variables, and navigating the DOM.

##Description

When the page is first loaded, the player is presented with a 'start' button that initiates the quiz when clicked.  Once the quiz has started, a timer begins counting down and the player is given the first question with 4 possible answers.  When an answer is clicked, if correct a 'good job!' notification appears along with a 'next' button to move on to the next question.  If the chosen answer is incorrect, a 'try again' notification appears and 15 seconds is taken off of the time remaining.  If the players is able to complete all of the questions before the time runs out, they are given their score which is the value of the time remaining.  The faster and more accurately the questions are answered, the higher the score.  

After the quiz is complete, they user may input their initials to submit along with their score.  They can then re take the quiz or view the list of high scores which have been saved in local storage.
